#OGINT

Google Chrome by default doesn't allow any type of UI in full screen mode. That means the search bar in the default new tab page won't work. Customizing new tab page is a pain. Therefore you need to exit full screen mode to type a URL in new tab. OGINT is a chrome extension that resolves this issue.


###Step 1:
>Download this repo on your system.

###Step 2:
>Install OGINT as Google Chrome extension.
Open [Chrome Extensions page](chrome://extensions/). Click on 'Load unpacked extensions..' and select OGINT directory.

###Step 3:
>Set keyboard shortcut for OGINT.
Open [Chrome Extensions page](chrome://extensions/). Scroll down and select 'Keyboard Shortcuts'. I've set 'Ctrl + G' as the shortcut.

###Step 4: 
>Disable Instant results in Google
Open google.com and go to settings. On Google Instant predictions, check 'Never show Instant results'. Now on Google homepage, type any url or just the website name and click on 'I'm feeling lucky' to directly open that website.
